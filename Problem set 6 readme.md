The only thing you really need to run this program is the mbox_short.txt which i will attach if you don't already have that. 

Some major issues i encountered along the way is trying to solve some of the problems, there are a few exercises where i wasn't sure if i did it correctly or not. But attempted to solve them. I did try to at least give it my best shot and do what makes sense but in the end, i'm not sure if some of these are correct.
